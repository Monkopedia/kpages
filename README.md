# KPages (Pronounced Ka-Pages, like Ka-Pow)

KPages is a simple library that provides skaffolding for multiplatform projects
for things like routing and navigation. It does not provide a whole view framework
and does not intend to. Instead it focuses on allowing more navigation and structural
logic to live in common code, with platform specific implementations.

It provides a preference implementation because they tend to be pretty basic and similar
across platforms and it provides a simple testbed that can be created in common code.
